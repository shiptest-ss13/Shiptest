changes:
  - {code_imp: Updated some status effect tick code to be more clear of how long
      is elapsing between ticks. Some effects that were inadvertently weakened 
      are now stronger as a result (fire and some heretic effects).}
  - {bugfix: Fixed grab offsets not showing for anything but passive grab}
  - {refactor: Refactored pixel offsets of mobs. Report any oddities}
  - {refactor: 'Replaced hardcoded "safeties" for lava, chasms and ignoring turf slowdowns
      on catwalks with traits.'}
  - {balance: 'much like catwalks, tables and conveyors also disable turf slowdowns.'}
  - {balance: slippery turfs won't slip you when walking on a table.}
  - {bugfix: pixel offsets from grabbing other mobs now respect the body offset 
      variables.}
  - {refactor: Changed some code so that resized mobs no longer look like 
      they're poking over the below tile with their legs or not even reaching 
      the bottom edge of the tile they're on.}
  - {rscadd: deep water swimming w/ immersive drowning}
