changes:
  - rscadd: Assorted space-worthy helmets can now act as masks for internals.
  - refactor: Internals code can now check any item with the ALLOWSINTERNALS flag
      through the GET_INTERNAL_SLOTS define. For now this only checks head and mask
      slots, since those are the most realistically speaking usable ones.
