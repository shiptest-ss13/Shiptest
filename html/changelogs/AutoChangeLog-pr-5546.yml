      behaviours.}

  - {bugfix: 'Other basic nutriment subtypes also carry food flavours, instead of
      outweighing the food flavours with their lack of flavour.'}
  - {bugfix: 'Basic nutriment subtypes have a flavour they default to, in case of
      not carrying any food flavours.'}
  - {bugfix: 'Tasted flavours can actually be "strong" in addition to mild or "a hint
      of", as intended.'}
