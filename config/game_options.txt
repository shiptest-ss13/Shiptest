## MOB MOVEMENT ###

## We suggest editing these variables ingame to find a good speed for your server.
## To do this you must be a high level admin. Open the 'debug' tab ingame.
## Select "Debug Controller" and then, in the popup, select "Configuration". These variables should have the same name.

## These values get directly added to values and totals ingame.
## To speed things up make the number negative, to slow things down, make the number positive.

## These modify the run/walk speed of all mobs before the mob-specific modifiers are applied.
RUN_DELAY 1.5
WALK_DELAY 3

## The variables below affect the movement of specific mob types. THIS AFFECTS ALL SUBTYPES OF THE TYPE YOU CHOOSE!
## Entries completely override all subtypes. Later entries have precedence over earlier entries.
## This means if you put /mob 0 on the last entry, it will null out all changes, while if you put /mob as the first entry and
## /mob/living/carbon/human on the last entry, the last entry will override the first.
##MULTIPLICATIVE_MOVESPEED /mob/living/carbon/human 0
##MULTIPLICATIVE_MOVESPEED /mob/living/silicon/robot 0
##MULTIPLICATIVE_MOVESPEED /mob/living/carbon/monkey 0
##MULTIPLICATIVE_MOVESPEED /mob/living/carbon/alien 0

## If undefined, the delay defaults to 4 minutes.
#REOPEN_ROUNDSTART_SUICIDE_ROLES_DELAY 240

## Unhash to enable a printed command report for reopened roles listing what roles were reopened.
#REOPEN_ROUNDSTART_SUICIDE_ROLES_COMMAND_REPORT


## ALERT LEVELS ###
ALERT_GREEN All threats to the sector have passed. Local security personnel may not have weapons visible, privacy laws are once again fully enforced. Employees are instructed to return to buisness as usual.
ALERT_BLUE_UPTO Potentially dangerous conditions have been reported in this sector. Corporate security staff have been granted increased powers, and security sweeps will now be organized.
ALERT_BLUE_DOWNTO The immediate threat to personal safety has passed. Corporate security may no longer have weapons drawn at all times, but may continue to have them visible. Privacy laws will continue to be suspended until an all-clear has been posted.
ALERT_RED_UPTO There is an immediate and serious threat to the sector. Local Security forces may have weapons unholstered at all times. Random searches will be allowed and advised. Colonial emergency supply restrictions have been lifted.
ALERT_RED_DOWNTO The sector's immediate destruction has been averted. There may, however, remain deadly threats to personal safety. Random searches will be allowed and advised to Nanotrasen peacekeepers.
ALERT_DELTA The destruction of the sector is imminent. All local persons are instructed to obey commands by Nanotrasen personnel. Any violations of these orders may be punishable by death. This is not a drill.
