/*

### This file contains a list of all the areas in any potential ship. Format is as follows:

/area/CATEGORY/OR/DESCRIPTOR/NAME 	(you can make as many subdivisions as you want)
	name = "NICE NAME" 				(not required but makes things really nice)
	icon = 'ICON FILENAME' 			(defaults to 'icons/turf/areas.dmi')
	icon_state = "NAME OF ICON" 	(defaults to "unknown" (blank))
	requires_power = FALSE 				(defaults to true)
	ambientsounds = list()				(defaults to grabbing from GENERIC_INDEX on area init.
	override it as "ambientsounds = list('sound/ambience/signal.ogg')" or setting its ambience_index to something else.

NOTE: there are two lists of areas in the end of this file: centcom and station itself. Please maintain these lists valid. --rastaf0
