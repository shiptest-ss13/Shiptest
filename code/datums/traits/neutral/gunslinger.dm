Those new-fangled and complicated firearms don't suit you; pistols and semi-automatic rifles suit you better, but revolvers in particular were made for you. You can fan single action revolvers, flip any revolver, and have mastery of the greatest handgun ever made. NOT RECOMENDED FOR BEGINNERS. ADVANCED PLAYERS ONLY."
