# Depreaciated Modularized Custom File Directory

## What it was

This directory existed to house custom code changes that could be properly seperated from the codebase and placed here. While Whitesands once mirrored /tg/ changes, and
	this directory was necessary to prevent merge conflicts and pain, it is no longer needed and can be properly disreguarded. Any help with demodularizing this folder
	 would be greatly appreciated.
