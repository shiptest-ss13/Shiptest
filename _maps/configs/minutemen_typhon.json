	"description": "The Typhon-class is a reliable conversion of an old miner-freighter, featuring spacious cargo decks that enable relatively long-term deployment for its crew size and the facilities needed to maintain an exosuit in working condition. The Typhon started service in 400 FS, serving as an escort for larger vessels just before the height of the Frontiersmen War, and later produced in large numbers after the liberation of Lanchester City. Nowadays, the nimble nature of Typhons make them well-suited to quickly respond to and deter small smuggling and pirate activity in fringe sectors.",
