	"description": "One of the few Sol-designed hulls used outside of official contexts by non-Confederation parties, the Inkwell is a freighter respected for its engineering and loved for its lavish crew accommodations. \n The Inkwell-class seen in numerous contexts, perhaps most notably among the Verwaltungskompanien, where they are essential in solving the logistic concerns of any proper military-administration-for-hire. Additionally, they are often commissioned and sold to non-Solarian parties for use in interstellar shipping. \n The usage of the Inkwell-class to move illicit or untracked cargo is known by any seasoned (or even half-cooked) port authority; \"...such regrettable actions by an outlier minority are mere part-and-parcel of the realities of interstellar shipping,\" goes the official reply.",
