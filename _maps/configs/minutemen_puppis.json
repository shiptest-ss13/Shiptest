	"description": "A design drafted for the Colonial Minutemen in a post-ICW Frontier - with the first launched in 501 FSC, the Puppis-class Multirole Corvette is a well equipped, nimble, and easy to adapt to changing situations. The above-average crew accommodations make it a popular assignment, while the cargo holds and typical gear allotment enable deployment on everything from standard patrol to delivering humanitarian aid. Multiple vectored engine blocks ensure that nary a captain will complain about its mobility. The sight of a Puppis-class burning into atmosphere is a sign that CLIP is here to stay",
