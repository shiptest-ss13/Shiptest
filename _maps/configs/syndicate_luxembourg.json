Co.’s fleet on the Frontier, where the ever-opportunistic corporation has begun to fill the gaps left behind by the collapse of Nanotrasen’s logistics network. Donk! Co. managers have a great degree of autonomy, and so any given Luxembourg will often bear substantial modifications to the sales floor and on-board cafe, the better to entice new customers in an unstable yet lucrative region of space.",
