Hoping to combine all of these qualities with the most important activity of all: making fat stacks of dosh? Then the Schmiedeberg-class is for you! Host to a robust ghetto chemistry lab, a high-efficiency botanical set-up and a complete kitchen-and-storefront, the Schmiedeberg is perfect for back-alley chemists and botanists everywhere.",
