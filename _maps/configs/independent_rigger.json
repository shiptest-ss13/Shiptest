	"description": "The Rigger-class is Kasagi-Fischer Partnership’s mainstay in the independent ship market. Spacious, affordable, and versatile, Riggers offer basic capabilities for everything a Frontier spacer might need in a convenient, easy-to-modify platform, and by default come equipped with a basic medbay, a small security office, atmospherics recycling and equipment to support an APLU utility mech. Thanks to this versatility, Riggers have become extremely popular among moderately-wealthy independent captains, and can be found doing everything from mining to shipping to surveying Frontier planets.",
