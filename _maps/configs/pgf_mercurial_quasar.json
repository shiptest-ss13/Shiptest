	"description": "A reliable reconnaissance vessel manufactured by Etherbor's PGFN Lihmona Navy Shipyard, the Mercurial Quasar was built to serve as a forward scouting and ambush clearing craft for larger fleet formations. Heavily armed for it's size with an impressive point defense suite and a powerful propulsion system, the Mercurial Quasar has the power it needs to get out of a bad situation in one piece. Despite it's light equipment load, with three on board marines and a highly cross trained crew, the Mercurial Quasar makes for an extremely flexible force multiplier on the frontier." ,
