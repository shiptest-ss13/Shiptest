	"description": "A common sight in N+S's Frontier fleet, the Kiwi-class acts as the company's mainstay prospecting vessel. Outfitted with a heavy-duty mining drill and armed mining team to ensure it's continued operation, these vessels are built to locate and capitalize on valuable near-surface mineral deposits. Boasting moderate cargo capacity, dual ore refineries, and comfortable (if cramped) crew cabins, Kiwis are designed to be self-sufficient for some time and tend to outcompete smaller, independent mining ventures.",
