	"description": "The Shetland is Miskilamo Spacefaring’s flagship offer and one of their only truly original designs: A huge frigate offering a diverse array of facilities with ample room for expansion at a fraction of the price of the competition. Optimistic customers soon discover the haphazard workmanship and extreme cost-cutting measures common to Miskilamo ships. While Shetlands have plenty of room and a theoretically diverse array of facilities, they come with the minimal amount of equipment needed for those facilities, and a wide array of design deficiencies have given them a grim reputation for driving their crews to paranoid extremes. The waste disposal chute is a frequent feature of such tales, and supposedly a great many Shetland crewmates have met their end by ejection.",
