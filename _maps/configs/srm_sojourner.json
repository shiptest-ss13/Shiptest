	"description": "First produced as the Estuary-class in 499FS for the civilian market, this hull is among Ihejirika's first widely adopted designs. In need of a supplier, the Saint-Roumain Militia commissioned the shipwright in 502FS for a fleet of custom modified Estuary-classes to provide to their Montagnes. Now known as the Sojourner-class, this ship has been tailored to suit the lifestyle of self-sufficiency for a band in the hunting order; the most notable refurbishment being a central garden featuring a tree imported from the owning Montagne's home planet. Modifications to the ship systems and hull are otherwise superficial.",
