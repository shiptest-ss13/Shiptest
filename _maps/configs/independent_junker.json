	"description": "The Junker-class is not an official class, but rather the name for a general group of designs crafted from the ruins of old ships or stations. These ships became a common sight during the ICW, as deserters fled areas of conflict on these 'junkers', unprepared for the challenges of spacer life. They have since become a rare sight, and the few surviving crews of these ships typically bear a sense of disdain to ordinary power structures, and usually have no defined captain, or even owner, of the vessel.",
