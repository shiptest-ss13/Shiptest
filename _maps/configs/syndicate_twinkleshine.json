	"description": "After the destruction of the larger Starfury-class Battle Cruisers during the Inter-Corporate War, Cybersun engineered the Twinkleshine as a replacement to fill the now-vacant flagship role. However, the war came to a close before any examples of this class could see combat. Now, they are kept as a valuable symbol of the Syndicate’s might and unity – in theory. As with the Starfury-class, Twinkleshine crews contain a mix of all Syndicate member factions as a matter of political necessity – none would consent to Cybersun operating such powerful ships alone. While Twinkleshine crews are supposedly selected for more diplomatic tendencies than one might expect, the political situation aboard a Twinkleshine is often delicate, particularly as tensions between the Syndicate’s corporate and anti-corporate elements continue to build. Nevertheless, they remain the most potent singular assets in the Syndicate’s combined arsenal, and frequently serve the role of power projection in Frontier space.",
