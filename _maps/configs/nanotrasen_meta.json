	"description": "The Meta-class is the mainline freighter of N+S Logistics, boasting incredible cargo capacity, spacious crew areas, and law-abiding levels of speed. It has been through a substantial redesign compared to its pre-war namesake, aiming to reduce accidents and increase supply throughput to make up for post-war defecits. The Meta-class frigate can most often be found in the frontier transporting cargo between outposts, delivering mail, and selling N+S goods and merchandise. N+S is not liable for any health issues or addictions that may occur while working aboard this vessel.",
