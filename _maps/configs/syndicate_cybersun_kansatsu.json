	"description": "The Kansatsu-class Scout-Courier is a Cybersun retrofit of obsolete Scanmag-class Fast Couriers, a design dating back to the early 200s F.S. The ubiquity of the Scanmag-class has made them an easy purchase for Cybersun, who can retrofit, equip, and deploy the newly christened Kansatsu into the Frontier. The typical mission goal of a Kansatsu is reconnaissance of assets in a particular system. Their speed allows them to undertake a wide variety of ‘odd-jobs’, ranging from high speed pizza delivery (a favorite of certain cybersun officials), to orbital insertion of an operative. A standard crew is no less than 4 people, but depending on the mission - a Kansatsu can safely carry up to 7, although there’s no guarantee that it will be comfortable.",
