	"description": "Some of the most modern ships in Nanotrasen’s fleet and a prestigious assignment for their captains, the famed Harrier of the ICW’s most dramatic astronautical engagements lives on as a very well-appointed exploration ship. Extensively refurbished and demilitarized from their origins as Bluespace Artillery platforms, the contemporary Harrier repurposes military-grade sensor equipment and AI systems for exploration and survey work. Supermatter reactors and military-grade shielding and weapons have also been stripped out in favor of improved accomodations. While the Harrier rebuilds are very well-rounded, they tend to be only moderately-equipped in any one department.",
