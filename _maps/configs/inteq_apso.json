	"description": "A relatively recent addition to the mercenary company's fleet, the construction of the Apso-class was outsourced to Hardline in 506FS with specifications for a small, purpose-built communications and support vessel. Outfitted with basic facilities and a powerful, long-range communications suite capable of networking IRMG ships cross-sector; this little ship typically operates as a signaller and reconnaissance vessel within operational range of larger friendly forces, bolstering coordination by directing communications and relaying strategic information. The Apso's importance to local coordinated efforts make it a prime target for pirates and adversaries, making it rare to see independent of another IRMG vessel. Crews of this vessel experience cramped living conditions with a smaller divide between the ranks, commonly assigned to greenhorn Vanguards with smaller influences - or experienced commanders willing to act as a keystone of coordination in more dangerous sectors of the Frontier.",
