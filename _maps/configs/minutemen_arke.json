	"description": "The Arke-class is a relatively new appearance in the Frontier, continuing it's use as a planet surveying ship for CLIP-LAND's colony development. The Arke is lightly equipped and crewed, specializing in gathering data to relay to allied ships in the sector. Despite it's size, it boasts a telecommunications array for sharing data and communication with other ships. Descending from the Proteus-class, designed for low-cost manufacturing and modularity, the Arke is deployed into the frontier with a specific goal, but remains able to adapt with it's relatively spaceful cargo bay.",
