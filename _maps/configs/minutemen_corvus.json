	"description": "A lightly equipped patrol vessel used by the Minutemen for extended operations in the Frontier. In many systems, a lone Corvus is the only sign of Minutemen presence, an image that is not helped by their widespread usage.  The Corvus was originally a light personal vessel retrofitted for combat usage by the Colonial Militia, which was later adopted as their official remote infantry patrol ship as a symbol of colonial ingenuity and grit.  First designated the Wallaby-class, until the crew of a now-legendary Wallaby-class known as the CMSV Corvus single handedly destroyed a Frontiersmen capital ship in 392.",
